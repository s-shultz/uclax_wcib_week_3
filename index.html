      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>This page is dedicated to my week 3 project for UCLA Extension Frontend Web Coding Bootcamp. I have chosen to publish this recipe, adapted from <strong><a href="https://www.browneyedbaker.com/pavlova-layer-cake/" title="the BrownEyedBaker" target="_blank">The Brown Eyed Baker</a></strong>. It is a great desert for anyone, especially if you are looking for a gluten free goodie. I hope you enjoy!
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <div class="box"></div>
        <h3>For the Pavlova</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>6 egg whites (room tempurature)</li>
          <li>Pinch of cream of tartar</li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Whipped Cream</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
          <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Filling</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>6-8 Guava</li>
          <li>Lime Juice</li>
          <li>Honey or Sweetner (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1 – Prepare: </strong>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (spray lightly with non-stick cooking spray) or non-stick sheet.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2 – Make the Pavlova: </strong>Using an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until frothy, then add the cream of tartar. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat to soft peaks. While continuing to beat the egg whites, gradually add the granulated sugar (about 3 tablespoons at a time) and beat until glossy and stiff peaks form. Divide the meringue evenly between the three circles and use an offset spatula to form a circular shape.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3 – Bake: </strong>Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until firm to the touch. Turn off the oven and allow the pavlova to cool completely inside. This will prevent cracking.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4 – Make the Whipped Cream: </strong>Place the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl and beat on medium-high speed until it holds soft peaks.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5 – Make the Puree: </strong>Scoop out guava (without seeds). Add guava fruit and honey to blender. Pulse on low speed until pureed. Pour through strainer into a bowl. Stir in lime juice. Chill.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6 – Assemble the Cake: </strong>Very gently lift one of the pavlova layers off of the baking sheet and place on a serving plate. Top with one-third of the whipped cream, and guava puree (as much as you like). Gently place another pavlova layer on top, spread another one-third of the whipped cream and add puree. Finally, top with the last pavlova layer, remaining whipped cream and more puree and garnish with fruit. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 4 hours.</p>
